    Adds a new 2-qubit gate, the echo cross-resonance (ECR), which is two
    CR(Ï€/4) pulses with an X gate between them for the echo. This gate is
    locally equivalent to a CNOT (can convert to a CNOT with local
    pre- or post-rotation). It is the native gate on current IBM hardware
    and compiling to it allows the pre-/post-rotations to be merged into
    the rest of the circuit.

    A new option `synthesis_fidelity` is added to the transpiler for
    approximate synthesis of unitaries. The synthesis fidelity can be
    given to the transpiler. This capability was already there in the
    synthesizer, it is just now exposed to the transpiler.
