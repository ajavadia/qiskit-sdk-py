"""Helper module for simplified Qiskit usage.

    This module includes
        run_circuits: runs a list of quantum circuits.
        run_schedule: (TODO) runs a schedule of pulses.
        run_algorithm: (TODO) runs a quantum algorithm from aqua.
        run_experiment: (TODO) runs a quantum ignis experiment

    In general we recommend using the SDK functions directly. However, to get something
    running quickly we have provider this wrapper module.
